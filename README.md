# Smart Door â€“ IoT Project  

This repository contains a project developed as part of the **Internet of Things** course at the *Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Computer Science and Information Technology Osijek (FERIT)*.  

The project, titled **Smart Door**, was created with the goal of combining hardware modules with IoT concepts to implement a functional smart system.

## Project Description  
The Smart Door system is built on the **Arduino Uno** platform and integrates multiple hardware modules to control and monitor door access.  

Key features include:  
- Use of various Arduino modules (sensors, actuators, communication modules).  
- Integration of **WebSockets** for real-time communication and remote control.  
- Management of Arduino components through a web-based interface.

## Technologies and Components Used  
- **Arduino Uno** (main microcontroller board)  
- Various sensors and actuators (depending on the chosen setup, e.g., RFID, servo motor, ultrasonic sensor, etc.)  
- **WebSocket protocol** for communication  
- Supporting Arduino libraries for hardware integration

## Purpose  
This project was developed as a **faculty assignment** for the Internet of Things course.  
It demonstrates the integration of embedded hardware with IoT communication protocols, showcasing how everyday objects (in this case, a door) can be made "smart" and remotely manageable.
